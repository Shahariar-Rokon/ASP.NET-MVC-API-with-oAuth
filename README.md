# ASP.NET MVC API with Master Detail - Hotel Service Reservation API


## Description

This is an ASP.NET MVC api project with oAuth authentication.oAuth is a token based authentication security system. 

In this project, I've created a hypothetical scenario about a software where you can:

- Save customer information.
- Add multiple Services that they had used in the hotel.
- Submit data using ASP.NET MVC API.
- Handle master-details relationships
- Using oauth token based authentication system based on OWIN

This project is intended to showcase the features and capabilities of ASP.NET MVC API with oauth token based authentication. Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or contributions.
